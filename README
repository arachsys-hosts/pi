System info
===========

pi is a Raspberry Pi 4B, with a 4-core BCM2711 Cortex-A72 SoC, integrated
VideoCore 6 GPU, 8G RAM, Broadcom gigabit NIC, BCM43455 wifi and a 224G
USB3-attached-SCSI SSD.

The SSD is GPT partitioned with a 256M vfat /boot, containing
the bootloader, kernel and device tree. See boot/config.txt and
boot/cmdline.txt for the bootloader config and kernel command line
respectively.

After building the kernel, install linux/arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz and
linux/arch/arm64/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb as /boot/linux.img
and /boot/rpi4b.dtb respectively. To cross-compile the kernel, use

  make -C linux ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-musl-

We use an ext4 root filesystem, with 1G zram swap to limit SSD wear.
TRIM is activated with

  echo -n unmap >/sys/block/sda/device/scsi_disk/*/provisioning_mode

early in /etc/init.

The Pi 4B lacks an RTC, so we try to keep the clock monotonic until NTP
sync takes over with

  if [[ -f /var/lib/ntpd.drift ]]; then
    date -s $(stat -c @%Z /var/lib/ntpd.drift) >/dev/null
  fi

on boot and

  touch -c /var/lib/ntpd.drift

on shutdown.


Updating the bootloader EEPROM
------------------------------

To update the EEPROM from an SD card, copy recovery.bin, pieeprom.bin and
vl805.bin from firmware/stable/ of

  https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom

to the first partition (vfat format) and generate checksums with

  sha256sum pieeprom.bin | cut -d ' ' -f 1 >pieeprom.sig
  sha256sum vl805.bin | cut -d ' ' -f 1 >vl805.sig
  date -u "+ts: %s" >>pieeprom.sig

Booting from this card will update the EEPROM before halting. Green HDMI
output and a rapidly-flashing green activity LED indicates success. Red
HDMI output indicates failure, and an error code is displayed via the
activity LED.

To update the EEPROM from the USB SSD, copy pieeprom.bin and vl805.bin to
/boot/pieeprom.upd and /boot/vl805.bin and generate checksums with

  sha256sum pieeprom.upd | cut -d ' ' -f 1 >pieeprom.sig
  sha256sum vl805.bin | cut -d ' ' -f 1 >vl805.sig
  date -u "+ts: %s" >>pieeprom.sig

The bootloader will update itself from these files on the next reboot if
they differ from the version already in EEPROM.


Upstream firmware binaries
--------------------------

The GPU binaries boot/start4.elf and boot/fixup4.dat are obtained from

  https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware

The firmware/brcm/brcmfmac43455-sdio.* files are obtained from

  https://github.com/RPi-Distro/firmware-nonfree

with the messy comments from the config files pruned using

  sed -e 's/ *#.*//' -e '/^ *$/d' -i brcmfmac43455-*.txt

The firmware/regulatory.db database is obtained from

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sforshee/wireless-regdb.git


Partitioning and filesystems
----------------------------

Create the GPT label and partitions:

  sfdisk /dev/sda <<< 'label: gpt'
  sfdisk -a /dev/sda <<< 'size=256M, type=uefi, name=boot'
  sfdisk -a /dev/sda <<< 'size=+, type=linux, name=root'

Make the boot and root filesystems:

  mkfs.vfat -n boot /dev/sda1
  mkfs.ext4 -L root -O project,quota /dev/sda2

Copy the bootloader, configuration, kernel and device tree from boot
to /boot. The Raspberry Pi firmware will boot from the USB SSD or from
an SD card automatically.
